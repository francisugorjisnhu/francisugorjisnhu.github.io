          <p><strong>Professional Self-Assessment</strong> Since beginning my journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have acquired a significant amount of knowledge and experience that has greatly enhanced my understanding of the field. This educational experience has not only increased my technical skills but has also bolstered my confidence, empowering me to strive for excellence in various areas of computer science. My ePortfolio serves a crucial purpose: it is a comprehensive showcase that illustrates my competencies, achievements, and professional aspirations. I aim to demonstrate my mastery in the field as I work toward building a successful career in computer science. Upon completing my undergraduate studies, I am determined to focus my career on Cybersecurity, a vital and rapidly evolving area within computer science. 

Recognizing the increasing importance of digital security in our interconnected world, I intend to earn the necessary certifications that will equip me with specialized skills relevant to this field. These certifications will not only enhance my qualifications but also increase my competitiveness in the job market. Moreover, I have set my sights on furthering my education by pursuing a master’s degree in Cybersecurity in the not-too-distant future. I believe that advanced studies will provide deeper insights and a broader skill set, enabling me to tackle complex security challenges and contribute meaningfully to the industry. By reviewing the technical artifacts included in my ePortfolio, one can see that I have developed a diverse and robust skill set, laying a strong foundation in computer science. I have gained a heightened awareness of the critical importance of security in technology, which fuels my passion and commitment to becoming a Cybersecurity professional. My goal is to blend my technical expertise with a thorough understanding of security protocols to safeguard information and systems effectively

          <p> <h5>Introduction</h5><hr></BR>As a software engineer, I recognize that code reviews play an essential role in the software development process. They serve as a systematic approach to ensuring the quality of our project’s code, allowing us to catch critical bugs and vulnerabilities at an early stage in the development lifecycle. By thoroughly reviewing code, we can enhance the maintainability and performance of the software, ultimately leading to a more robust final product.

However, I understand that the typical code review process can sometimes feel tedious. Frequent meetings, lengthy discussions, and the potential for miscommunication can lead to wasted time and frustration among team members. This can create a perception that code reviews add unnecessary bureaucracy to our development workflow. 

Additionally, some teams may feel that they are too small or that their codebase doesn’t warrant the effort of a formal review process. This thinking can be detrimental, as even small teams can benefit significantly from code reviews. They foster collaboration, facilitate knowledge sharing among team members, and ensure that best practices are upheld.

In both scenarios, whether viewing code reviews as a burden or as unnecessary for small teams, we are making a mistake. Embracing a structured code review process can lead to improved code quality, team cohesion, and overall project success.

Code review is a thorough and systematic examination of computer source code, commonly known as peer review.<br><h5>Concept behind Reviewing Code</h5><hr>
                    
This process serves multiple purposes, primarily aimed at identifying and rectifying mistakes that may have been overlooked during the initial development phase. By doing so, it significantly enhances the overall quality of the software while also fostering the growth and skills of individual developers.

In the professional programming landscape, code reviews are a fundamental component of quality assurance. They provide an opportunity for developers to share knowledge, discuss different coding approaches, and collaboratively solve problems. This not only leads to more robust and reliable code but also encourages best practices within the team.

Code reviews can be conducted in several ways, including formal reviews, informal discussions, or using specialized tools that facilitate the process. Each method can be tailored to meet specific project requirements and team dynamics. Despite the various approaches, the essence of code review remains simple: it is an essential practice that helps catch bugs, improves code readability, ensures adherence to coding standards, and ultimately leads to higher quality software.

For anyone passionate about software engineering, engaging in code reviews is vital for personal and professional development.  <br><h5> Factors That promote Code Reviews</h5><hr>

<h3>Artifact 3 Databases</h3>
<h5>Introduction:</h5>

The artifact I have chosen for Enhancement Three: Databases stems from a project developed during the CS 360 - Mobile Architecture and Development course. Throughout this class, we were engaged in the comprehensive task of creating a fully functional mobile application using the Java programming language, with Android Studio serving as our integrated development environment (IDE).

The primary objective of our project was to design an application that operates seamlessly on various Android devices, including smartphones and tablets powered by the Android operating system. The application was specifically intended to serve as an inventory management tool, enabling users to efficiently manage a list of products.

Key features of the application include the ability for users to view a list of existing products, add new items to their inventory, update details of previously added products, and delete items that are no longer needed. To store and manage this data effectively, we implemented a SQLite database. This database is designed to be created dynamically during runtime, ensuring that it is established if it does not already exist. This functionality allows the application to operate reliably without requiring manual database setup.

Overall, this project not only enhanced my understanding of database management within mobile applications but also provided hands-on experience with critical concepts in mobile architecture. Below, you will find a depiction of the Android Studio application we developed:
<br/>
        <img src="cs360_1.png" alt="CS360" style="width:100%" class="w3-padding-16">                        
                                
                     <br/>    

<h5>Enhancement Strategy</h5>

The enhancement of this artifact involved a comprehensive process that included the creation of a new database tailored for the application. This new database is built on the MySQL platform, which is known for its reliability and performance.

To establish a seamless connection between the application and the MySQL database, I developed specific code to handle this integration. A critical component of this process was the use of an ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) connector, which facilitates communication between the application written in Java and the MySQL database within the Android Studio environment.

This task required not only the configuration of connection settings but also the implementation of CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are fundamental for enabling the application to interact with the database effectively, allowing it to store, retrieve, modify, and delete data as needed.

Through these enhancements, I have had the opportunity to showcase my skills in working with various database technologies and demonstrate my understanding of their functionalities. This experience also highlights my capability to adapt to different database systems, reinforcing my expertise in application development.
